# Todoey âœ“

## Project Goal

Understanding how to manage state in Flutter. Various Flutter architecture choices and how to use the officially recommended Provider package to manage app state.

## What is todoey?

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.

## What I implemented

- Implemented the Provider package with ChangeNotifierProvider to listen for data from parent without needing to rebuild the intervening widgets.
- Implemented the List Builder to create widget list.
- Implemented the Flutter BottomSheet Widget for new todo input.

## What I learned
- The difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
- The problems with simply relying on setState().
- The concept of Prop Drilling.
- Popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
- How to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
- Design patterns and why they are useful.
