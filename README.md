# Todoey âœ“

## Project Goal

In this project is we understand how to manage state in Flutter. We'll look at various Flutter architecture choices and learn to use the officially recommended Provider package to manage our app state.

## What is todoey?

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.

## What I implemented

- Implemented the Provider package and with ChangeNotifierProvider to listen for data from parent without needing to rebuild the intervening widgets.
- Implemented the List Builder to create widget list.
- Implemented the Flutter BottomSheet Widget for new todo input.

## What I learned
- The difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
- The problems with simply relying on setState().
- The concept of Prop Drilling.
- Popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
- How to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
- Design patterns and why they are useful.
